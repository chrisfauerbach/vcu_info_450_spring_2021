# Agenda

1. Decorators
2. Database Integration
3. REST APIs (for real this time)



---
# Important things to remember

Everything in Python is an object.  

Objects can be assigned to variables.

Transitively (?) ANYTHING in Python can be assigned to a variable.

* Data
* Functions
* Methods
* Classes
* Objects
* ...

```python

def foo():
    print "bar"

bar = foo # What happens here?
bar()

# How is that different from:

bar = foo() 
print(bar)
```

---
# Decorators

A decorator is the name used for a software design pattern. Decorators dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method, or class without having to directly use subclasses or change the source code of the function being decorated.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern

---
# Python Decorators

A Python decorator is a specific change to the Python syntax that allows us to more conveniently alter functions and methods


Let's look at an example, from realpython.org

---
# Simple Decorator Pattern

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee)

say_whee() #Here?

```

Can you guess what happens?

---
# Output


```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee)

say_whee() #Here?

```
```python
>>> say_whee()
Something is happening before the function is called.
Whee!
Something is happening after the function is called.

```
---
# What's happening in that code?

- Two functions are defined (my_decorator, say_whee)
- A 'closure' is defined (function within a function)
- my_decorator function is called with a parameter of a function
 - Not the return value of a function, but the actual function object
- my_decorator returns the closure to the 'main' code
- main code overwrites the say_whee function name with the closure
- calling say_whee now actually calls the closure, which REMEMBERS the original function 
- closure prints something, calls the original function, then prints something else
- It's code, you can do anything in that closure!


```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee)

say_whee() #Here?

```



---

## Put simply: decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior.


## When and Why would we do that?

---

# Examples

* Log state before and after function call
* Perform authorization validation / is logged in checks
* 'time' function calls
* handle error conditions
* handle resource policies
* abstract items like database connections, file handles

---
# Can we make it prettier?

* Python has syntax sugar for decorators using the : @ symbol

Syntax:

```python
@dec2
@dec1
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass

# Equivalent to

def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
func = dec2(dec1(func))

```


---

# Translating to our old code:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee)
say_whee()
```

```python
@my_decorator
def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee()
```

---
# What does this do?

```python
from datetime import datetime

def myster_action_for_class(func):
    def wrapper():
        if 7 <= datetime.now().hour < 22:
            func()
        else:
            pass  # Hush, the neighbors are asleep
    return wrapper

def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee = myster_action_for_class(say_whee)
say_whee()

```
---
## Now hold that in the back of your mind, while we talk about databases



---
# Database Integration

* Relational databases (or any other type of database, for the most part) can permanently store data that can be accessed by an application
* Examples of relational databases:  
 * MS SQL Server
 * Oracle
 * Postgresql
 * Mysql
 * MariaDB
* Python can integrate with any of them.



## Anyone used a relational database before?

---
# Python - Database Integration

* Python Database API - DB-API
* https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/db/

* In this section, we'll be using 'sqlite3' as our example, so we don't have external dependencies.
* SQLite 3 is a disk-based relational database, great for prototyping or small work loads.

* Python's 'sqlite3' module meets the specs of the DB-API 2.0

---
# Steps to interact with a database

1. Create a connection
2. Get a 'cursor' (This is what you interact with)
3. Execute commands (queries, updates, inserts, etc)
4. Commit your transaction
5. Close your connection (ALWAYS CLOSE YOUR CONNECTION)

---
# Before we code

* Database interactions are some of the slowest parts of computing

* Network conectivity is slow

* We'll figure out how to improve performance as we go along

---
# To the code

```python

# Impor the sqlite3 library
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to the database
# this will open or create a file 'example.db'
# on your system
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

```

<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">https://www.sqlite.org/index.html</a>

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day. More Information...

The SQLite file format is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compatible and the developers pledge to keep it that way through at least the year 2050. SQLite database files are commonly used as containers to transfer rich content between systems and as a long-term archival format for data. There are over 1 trillion (1e12) SQLite databases in active use.

SQLite source code is in the public-domain and is free to everyone to use for any purpose.

---
# More code

```python
# Cursor is the 'interactive' method for modifying the db
# You create a cursor from the connection
c = conn.cursor()

# Create table - tables store data.
# Tables will have/can have many 'rows' representing items
# Tables have columns representing data points.  
# Rows have 'fields' which is the value in the column
# That was info610 in 4 bullets
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE stocks
             (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')

# Insert a row of data
 
c.execute("INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)")

# Save (commit) the changes
# This ensures that all data hasn't been lost
conn.commit()

# We will close the connection if we are done with it.
# If you haven't committed your changes, they will be lost.
conn.close()

```

---
# Quick SQL overview

* Query
* Insert
* Update
* Delete


## Insert 
* `insert into [table] ([columns]) values ([values])`
* e.g.   - `INSERT INTO stocks (date, trans, symbol, qty, price) values ('2020-11-11', 'SELL', 'MKL', 30, 1500.0)`


## Query
* `select [columns] from [table(s)] [WHERE [filter]] [ORDER BY columns]`
* e.g.   - `SELECT * FROM stocks`
* e.g.   - `SELECT date, symbol FROM stocks WHERE symbol = 'MKL'`


We may skip update/delete for now.

# Create a database for our movies

In the interest of time, let's pick a few columns that are important.

1. id
2. Title
3. Original Title
4. Budget
5. Homepage
6. imdb_id
7. Release Date
8. Revenue
9. Runtime
10. Vote Average
11. Vote Count

Create Statement to make the table

`CREATE TABLE movies (id int primary key, homepage varchar, imdb_id varchar,
    release_date date, revenue real, runtime real, vote_average real, 
    vote_count int);`


---

From a software design standpoint, we'll build 4 components.
1. Create the database - initialize.py (sqlite3)
2. Insert the data     - load_data.py (pandas, sqlite3)
3. API server - server.py (flask, sqlite3)
4. API client - client.py (requests)

---
# initialize.py

```python
import sqlite3

def create_database(filename):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(filename)
    return conn


def create_structure(conn):
    c = conn.cursor()
    CREATE_SQL = """
         CREATE TABLE movies (id int primary key, title varchar, original_title varchar,
         budget real, homepage varchar, imdb_id varchar,
         release_date date, revenue real, runtime real, vote_average real,
         vote_count int);
    """
    c.execute(CREATE_SQL)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    conn = create_database('database.sqlite3.db')
    create_structure(conn)
    if conn:
        conn.close()
```

### Execute 
```bash
➜  src git:(master) ✗ python3 initialize.py
➜  src git:(master) ✗ file database.sqlite3.db
database.sqlite3.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3028000
➜  src git:(master) ✗
```

# Prep for pandas

I'll be doing this command line, not using Jupyter Notebook

```bash
$ # I like pipenv
$ brew install pipenv # or however you do it on your OS
$ pipenv --python `which python3`
$ pipenv shell
$ pipenv install numpy pandas
$ # Now I have a virtual environment that I can run this code.
```

### Don't forget to remove these three rows from the CSV file:

# load_data.py

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

def load_row(movie):
    conn = get_database('database.sqlite3.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    LOAD_SQL = """

    c.execute(LOAD_SQL, (movie['id'], movie['title'], movie['original_title'], movie['budget'],
                         movie['homepage'], movie['imdb_id'], movie['release_date'], movie['revenue'],
                         movie['runtime'], movie['vote_average'], movie['vote_count'] ))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def get_database(filename):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(filename)
    return conn



if __name__ == "__main__":
    movies = pd.read_csv("movies_metadata.csv")
    for k, row in movies.iterrows():
        load_row(row)
```

```bash
✗ python load_data.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/lin138/Documents/Projects/info610_fall_2020/week13/src/load_data.py", line 28, in <module>

    c.execute(LOAD_SQL, (movie['id'], movie['title'], movie['original_title'], movie['budget'],
sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: movies.id
```
This took about 90 seconds on my laptop:

<a href="./src/load_data.py">load_data.py</a>

---
# Nuts!

Unique key constraints.  Tells me that the source data doesn't really mean 'primary key' unless it's truly a duplicate..   

To fix it, we can add a 'new' primary key (like a UUID , or an integer counter) but for now, let's just trap the exception

```        
try:
    load_row(row)
except:
    logging.error("Duplicate primary key: %s", (row['id'], ))
```

I couldn't figure out what they were as far as IDs go, one was a duplicate record, one was not.

# Python Code to Query the DB

This is going to teach us a few things in order to build our web API

* When we build an API, we'll have a function call that happens when the HTTP request occurs

* The Flask library will map the request, to the function.   Let's keep that in mind.

```python
✗ cat first_query.py
import sqlite3
import logging


def get_database(filename):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(filename)
    return conn

def query_rows():
    conn = get_database('database.sqlite3.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    SELECT_QUERY = " SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 5; "
    result = c.execute(SELECT_QUERY)
    print(result)
    print(type(result))
    for movie in result:
        print(type(movie), movie)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query_rows()
```
<a href="first_query.py">first_query.py</a>

# first_query.py

```bash
✗ python first_query.py

# Return Type

The return type, by default, is a "Cursor" object.   This object has lots of database specific things in it.

When we iterate (for loop) on the cursor, we get a set of 'tuples'.

Tuples are a great, immutable data type, but here's how we "get" the titles:

```python
    for movie in result:
        print("Found Title: {}".format(movie[1]))
```

How do we know which index in the tuple will be which field, we 'selected *'?

Trial and error is no fun.

<a href="second_query.py">second_query.py</a>

Let's use a map

---
# Row Factory

We can override the default 'row factory' with a 'Row' factory so we can access items by column name.

```python
def get_database(filename):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(filename)
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    return conn
```

```python
    for movie in result:
        print("Found Title: {}".format(movie["title"]))
```

This allows you to change the order of columns in the query without changing your subsequent code.

<a href="third_query.py">third_query.py</a>

---
# Parameterizing Queries

When we query records in a database, we typically want to 'find' items based on certain criteria.  

Whether it's a 'description' or 'title' in our Movies , or by ID to get a specific item.  

Here are a few example functions:



---
```python

import sqlite3
import logging

def dict_factory(cursor, row):
    d = {}
    for idx, col in enumerate(cursor.description):
        d[col[0]] = row[idx]
    return d


def get_database(filename):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(filename)
    # Changed for a real dictionary!
    conn.row_factory = dict_factory
    return conn

def search_title(descr):
    results = []
    conn = get_database('database.sqlite3.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    parm = "%{}%".format(descr)
    SELECT_QUERY = " SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title like ? LIMIT 5 "
    result = c.execute(SELECT_QUERY, (parm,))
    for movie in result:
        results.append(movie)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return results

def search_id(id):
    conn = get_database('database.sqlite3.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    SELECT_QUERY = " SELECT * FROM movies WHERE id = ?;"
    result = c.execute(SELECT_QUERY, (id, ))
    movie = result.fetchone()
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return movie

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_movie = search_id(15602)
    print("15602")
    print(my_movie)
    my_movie = search_id(11862)
    print("11862")
    print(my_movie)

    my_movies = search_title('grumpier')
    print("grumpier")
    for movie in my_movies:
        print(f"{movie['id']}: {movie['title']} ")

    my_movies = search_title('star')
    print("star")
    for movie in my_movies:
        print(f"{movie['id']}: {movie['title']} ")


```

---
# Too much code

Lots of repetition.  The database connection code is repeated over and over.. and will be for every 'endpoint' or function we create.

What if this:
```python
def search_title(descr):
    results = []
    conn = get_database('database.sqlite3.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    parm = "%{}%".format(descr)
    SELECT_QUERY = " SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title like ? LIMIT 5 "
    result = c.execute(SELECT_QUERY, (parm,))
    for movie in result:
        results.append(movie)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return results
```

Could become:
```python
@db
def search_title(descr, c=None):
    results = []
    parm = "%{}%".format(descr)
    SELECT_QUERY = " SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title like ? LIMIT 5 "
    result = c.execute(SELECT_QUERY, (parm,))
    for movie in result:
        results.append(movie)
    return results
```

That example doesn't remove much code, but, it removes the boilerplate stuff.  We can use a 'decorator' to make this happen.

---
# Decorator

decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior.

Notice this:
```python
def search_title(descr):
```
becomes
```python
@db
def search_title(descr, c=None):
```

'db' is the decorator.  We use the @ symbol to show that it's going to 'wrap' the function

---
# my db decorator

My goal with the `db` function is to be able to inject the database cursor for any method that needs it.  

That `abstracts` the details of the database away from that function.  

This helps with:
* cleaner code
* ability to test easier
* hides changes to databases within one block of code.

Let's look at the `db` decorator

---
# @db

```python
from functools import wraps

def db(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper_to_add(*args, **kwargs):
        cur = None
        conn = None
        try:
            conn = get_database('database.sqlite3.db')
            conn.row_factory = dict_factory
            cur = conn.cursor()
            a = func(*args, c=cur, **kwargs)
            logging.debug("Func returned a: ", a)
            conn.commit()

            return a
        except:
            logging.exception("Exception while processing. Will Attempt to Rollback")
            try:
                if conn:  conn.rollback()
            except:
                logging.exception("Had an issue rolling back.")
                traceback.print_exc(file=sys.stdout)
        finally:
            if cur:  cur.close()
            if conn:  conn.close()
    return wrapper_to_add

```
