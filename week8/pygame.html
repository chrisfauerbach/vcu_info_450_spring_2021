# step1.py

```python
# Simple pygame program

# Import and initialize the pygame library
import pygame

# Setup the pygame engine
pygame.init()

# Set up the drawing window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode([500, 500])

# Run until the user asks to quit
running = True
while running:

    # Did the user click the window close button?
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Fill the background with white
    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))

    # Draw a solid blue circle in the center
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 0, 255), (250, 250), 75)

    # Flip the display
    pygame.display.flip()

# Done! Time to quit.
pygame.quit()
```
---
# Adding controls

After you import pygame, you‚Äôll also need to initialize it. This allows pygame to connect its abstractions to your specific hardware:


```python
# Import pygame.locals for easier access to key coordinates
# Updated to conform to flake8 and black standards
from pygame.locals import (
    K_UP,
    K_DOWN,
    K_LEFT,
    K_RIGHT,
    K_ESCAPE,
    KEYDOWN,
    QUIT,
)

```

---
# Set up the display

```python
# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Define constants for the screen width and height
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# Create the screen object
# The size is determined by the constant SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

```
<a href="src/step2.py">step2.py</a>

# Game Loop

The central component of any game, from a programming standpoint, is the game loop. The game loop allows the game to run smoothly regardless of a user's input or lack thereof.

Most traditional software programs respond to user input and do nothing without it. For example, a word processor formats words and text as a user types. If the user doesn't type anything, the word processor does nothing. Some functions may take a long time to complete, but all are initiated by a user telling the program to do something.

Every game from Pong to Fortnite uses a game loop to control gameplay. The game loop does four very important things:

* Processes user input
* Updates the state of all game objects
* Updates the display and audio output
* Maintains the speed of the game


Games, on the other hand, must continue to operate regardless of a user's input. The game loop allows this. A highly simplified game loop, in pseudocode, might look something like this :

```
while (user does not exit)
    check for user input
    run AI
    move enemies
    resolve collisions
    draw graphics
    play sounds
end while
```



---
# Processing Events

Every event in pygame has an event type associated with it. 

For your game, the event types you‚Äôll focus on are keypresses and window closure. 

Keypress events have the event type KEYDOWN, and the window closure event has the type QUIT. 

Different event types may also have other data associated with them. 

For example, the KEYDOWN event type also has a variable called key to indicate which key was pressed.

```python
# Variable to keep the main loop running
running = True

# Main loop
while running:
    # Look at every event in the queue
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Did the user hit a key?
        if event.type == KEYDOWN:
            # Was it the Escape key? If so, stop the loop.
            if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
                running = False

        # Did the user click the window close button? If so, stop the loop.
        elif event.type == QUIT:
            running = False
```

# Drawing on the screen

So far, we've drawn with:
 * screen.fill() to fill the background
 * pygame.draw.circle() to draw a circle

## Surface

Surface is a rectangular object on which you can draw, like a blank sheet of paper. The screen object is a Surface, and you can create your own Surface objects separate from the display screen. 

```python3
# Fill the screen with white
screen.fill((255, 255, 255))

# Create a surface and pass in a tuple containing its length and width
surf = pygame.Surface((50, 50))

# Give the surface a color to separate it from the background
surf.fill((0, 0, 0))
rect = surf.get_rect()
```

<a href="src/step4.py">step4.py</a>


---
# blit and Flip

Just creating a new Surface isn‚Äôt enough to see it on the screen. 
To do that, you need to blit the Surface onto another Surface. 
The term blit stands for Block Transfer, and .blit() is how you copy the contents of one Surface to another. 
You can only .blit() from one Surface to another, but since the screen is just another Surface, that‚Äôs not a problem. 
Here‚Äôs how you draw surf on the screen:

```python
screen.blit(surf, (SCREEN_WIDTH/2, SCREEN_HEIGHT/2))
pygame.display.flip()

```

<a href="src/step5.py">step5.py</a>

Center it:
```python
# Put the center of surf at the center of the display
surf_center = (
    (SCREEN_WIDTH-surf.get_width())/2,
    (SCREEN_HEIGHT-surf.get_height())/2
)

# Draw surf at the new coordinates
screen.blit(surf, surf_center)

```

<a href="src/step6.py">step6.py</a>

# Sprites

In your game design, the player starts on the left, and obstacles come in from the right. 
You can represent all the obstacles with Surface objects to make drawing everything easier, but how do you know where to draw them? 
How do you know if an obstacle has collided with the player? 
What happens when the obstacle flies off the screen? 
What if you want to draw background images that also move? 
What if you want your images to be animated? 
You can handle all these situations and more with sprites.

In programming terms, a sprite is a 2D representation of something on the screen. 
Essentially, it‚Äôs a picture. 
pygame provides a Sprite class, which is designed to hold one or several graphical representations of any game object that you want to display on the screen. 
To use it, you create a new class that extends Sprite. 
This allows you to use its built-in methods.

```python
# Define a Player object by extending pygame.sprite.Sprite
# The surface drawn on the screen is now an attribute of 'player'
class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Player, self).__init__()
        self.surf = pygame.Surface((75, 25))
        self.surf.fill((255, 255, 255))
        self.rect = self.surf.get_rect()
```

```python
# Import the pygame module
import pygame

# Import pygame.locals for easier access to key coordinates
# Updated to conform to flake8 and black standards
from pygame.locals import (
    K_UP,
    K_DOWN,
    K_LEFT,
    K_RIGHT,
    K_ESCAPE,
    KEYDOWN,
    QUIT,
)

# Define constants for the screen width and height
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# Define a player object by extending pygame.sprite.Sprite
# The surface drawn on the screen is now an attribute of 'player'
class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Player, self).__init__()
        self.surf = pygame.Surface((75, 25))
        self.surf.fill((255, 255, 255))
        self.rect = self.surf.get_rect()

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Create the screen object
# The size is determined by the constant SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

# Instantiate player. Right now, this is just a rectangle.
player = Player()

# Variable to keep the main loop running
running = True

# Main loop
while running:
    # for loop through the event queue
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Check for KEYDOWN event
        if event.type == KEYDOWN:
            # If the Esc key is pressed, then exit the main loop
            if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
                running = False
        # Check for QUIT event. If QUIT, then set running to false.
        elif event.type == QUIT:
            running = False

# User Input

Let's make your Player move!

After your event loop:

```python

# Get the set of keys pressed and check for user input
pressed_keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
```

```python
# Add to the player class
# Move the sprite based on user keypresses
def update(self, pressed_keys):
    if pressed_keys[K_UP]:
        self.rect.move_ip(0, -5)
    if pressed_keys[K_DOWN]:
        self.rect.move_ip(0, 5)
    if pressed_keys[K_LEFT]:
        self.rect.move_ip(-5, 0)
    if pressed_keys[K_RIGHT]:
        self.rect.move_ip(5, 0)
```

```python
# Main loop
while running:
    # for loop through the event queue
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Check for KEYDOWN event
        if event.type == KEYDOWN:
            # If the Esc key is pressed, then exit the main loop
            if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
                running = False
        # Check for QUIT event. If QUIT, then set running to false.
        elif event.type == QUIT:
            running = False

    # Get all the keys currently pressed
    pressed_keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    # Update the player sprite based on user keypresses
    player.update(pressed_keys)

    # Fill the screen with black
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))

```
<a href="src/step9.py">step9.py</a>

# Keep it on the board

```python
# Move the sprite based on user keypresses
def update(self, pressed_keys):
    if pressed_keys[K_UP]:
        self.rect.move_ip(0, -5)
    if pressed_keys[K_DOWN]:
        self.rect.move_ip(0, 5)
    if pressed_keys[K_LEFT]:
        self.rect.move_ip(-5, 0)
    if pressed_keys[K_RIGHT]:
        self.rect.move_ip(5, 0)

    # Keep player on the screen
    if self.rect.left < 0:
        self.rect.left = 0
    if self.rect.right > SCREEN_WIDTH:
        self.rect.right = SCREEN_WIDTH
    if self.rect.top <= 0:
        self.rect.top = 0
    if self.rect.bottom >= SCREEN_HEIGHT:
        self.rect.bottom = SCREEN_HEIGHT
```

---
# Let's add some bad guys

```python
import random
```

```python
# Define the enemy object by extending pygame.sprite.Sprite
# The surface you draw on the screen is now an attribute of 'enemy'
class Enemy(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Enemy, self).__init__()
        self.surf = pygame.Surface((20, 10))
        self.surf.fill((255, 255, 255))

        # Random location on the right side
        self.rect = self.surf.get_rect(
            center=(
                random.randint(SCREEN_WIDTH + 20, SCREEN_WIDTH + 100),
                random.randint(0, SCREEN_HEIGHT),
            )
        )
        self.speed = random.randint(5, 20)

    # Move the sprite based on speed
    # Remove the sprite when it passes the left edge of the screen
    def update(self):
        self.rect.move_ip(-self.speed, 0)
        if self.rect.right < 0:
            self.kill()
```


---
# Sprite Groups to keep trakc

```python
# Instantiate player. Right now, this is just a rectangle.
player = Player()

# Create groups to hold enemy sprites and all sprites
# - enemies is used for collision detection and position updates
# - all_sprites is used for rendering
enemies = pygame.sprite.Group()
all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group()
all_sprites.add(player)

# Variable to keep the main loop running
running = True

```

Then draw all sprites:
```python
# Draw all sprites
for entity in all_sprites:
    screen.blit(entity.surf, entity.rect)
```
