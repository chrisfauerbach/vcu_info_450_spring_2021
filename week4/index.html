# Zen of Python

```python
import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
```

* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Readability counts
* There should be one <strong>and preferably only one</strong> way to do it
* Now is better than never.

---
# Lists

A list is a collection of items in a particular order.

You can put anything you want into a list

Bound by brackets  [    ]

Lists should be named something plural e.g. 'students', 'customers', 'deer'

<sub>(See what I did there?)</sub>



```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Create a list of 'bicycle' manufacturers
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']

# Get the length (len()) of the list
logging.debug("Length of bicycles: %d", len(bicycles))
logging.debug(bicycles)
```

* I probably won't always enter the import logging and logging.basicConfig calls in each code example, but, you will need to if you use logging.

---
# Printing a List

When you print a list in Python (print or logging, I prefer logging) - Python returns a string representation of your list, brackets included.

```python
>>> logging.debug("Length of bicycles: %d", len(bicycles))
DEBUG:root:Length of bicycles: 4
>>> logging.debug(bicycles)
DEBUG:root:['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
```

---
# Access Elements in a list

The list contains elements in an order. A developer can access each item by its index:

```python
>>> bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
>>> logging.debug(bicycles[0])            # Get the first item in the list
DEBUG:root:trek
>>> logging.debug(bicycles[1])            # Get the second item in the list
DEBUG:root:cannondale
>>> logging.debug(bicycles[0].title())    # Call the title function, 
                                          # on the first item....
DEBUG:root:Trek
```

### Python starts counting/indexing at 0
<sub>because it's a real programming language</sub>

---
# CRUD
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

```python
>>> # Create a list
>>> motorcycles = ['honda','yamaha','harley-davidson']
>>> motorcycles
['honda', 'yamaha', 'harley-davidson']
>>> # Change/update an item in the list
>>> motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
>>> motorcycles
['ducati', 'yamaha', 'harley-davidson'A
>>> # Append an item to the end (right) of the list
>>> motorcycles.append('honda')
>>> motorcycles
['ducati', 'yamaha', 'harley-davidson', 'honda']

```

* append(itm) - Adds to the end of the list.  New, highest index.
---
# Dynamically creating and adding

```python
>>> motorcycles = []
>>> motorcycles.append('honda')
>>> motorcycles.append('yamaha')
>>> motorcycles.append('harley-davidson')
>>> motorcycles
['honda', 'yamaha', 'harley-davidson']
```

## Inserting , not appending

```python
>>> motorcycles
['honda', 'yamaha', 'harley-davidson']
>>> # Insert an item in the middle (index 2) of the list
>>> motorcycles.insert(2, 'suzuki')
>>> motorcycles
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'harley-davidson']

```
---
# Deleting items from the list

Python has a keyword: <i>del</i> to delete.  This deletes variables from memory, items in the list, etc

```python
>>> motorcycles
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'harley-davidson']
>>> del motorcycles[2]
>>> motorcycles
['honda', 'yamaha', 'harley-davidson']
>>> # Get and remove the last (highest index) item
>>> # and store it in a variable
>>> bike = motorcycles.pop()
>>> motorcycles
['honda', 'yamaha']
>>> bike
'harley-davidson'
>>> # Optional parameter to pop is an index
>>> new_bike = motorcycles.pop(0)
>>> motorcycles
['yamaha']
>>> new_bike
'honda'
>>> yamaha_bike = 'yamaha'
>>> # Remove function finds a value that's equal and removes it
>>> motorcycles.remove(yamaha_bike)
>>> motorcycles
[]

```
---
# Organizing a list

* Permanent sort

```python
>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
>>> cars
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
>>> # Natural (alphabetical) sort
>>> cars.sort()
>>> cars
['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
>>> # Reverse the natural sorting
>>> cars.sort(reverse=True)
>>> cars
['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi']

```
---
# Temporary Sort

Maintain the original ordered list, but provide a sorted 'copy'

```python
>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
>>> sorted(cars)
['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
>>> sorted_cars = sorted(cars)
>>> sorted_cars
['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
>>> cars
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']

```

---
# Other things

```python
>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
>>> cars
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
>>> cars.reverse()   # Reverse the order of the list
>>> cars
['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']
>>> len(cars)        # Get the lists length
4
>>> cars[-1]         # Get the last item from the list
'bmw'
>>> cars[0]          # Get the first item in the list
'subaru'
>>> cars[0:1]        # Get a SLICE of the list (notice the type printed)
['subaru']
>>> cars[1:3]        # Get a slice with more than one element
['toyota', 'audi']
>>> cars[55]         # Don't access items that don't exist!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```
---
# Working with lists

One of the most used control structures in Python has to do with iterating through every element in a list.

Example from the book:  in a game, you might want to move every element on the screen.
* Print out todays stock market
* List all orders
* Verify inventory

Iterating lists is probably 75% of what we do in computer programming.   Get comfortable.

---
#  for

The `for` loop construct allows you to not worry about how many items are in a list

```python
magicians = ['alice', 'pat', 'pallavi', 'sam']

# For loop helps us iterate the list. 
# Can be thought of as: "for each item in the list, do something with that item"

# In this example, the individual item will be assigned to the variable: magician
# for each magician in the list of magicians, let's log it
for magician in magicians:
     logging.debug(magician)
logging.debug("DONE")

DEBUG:root:alice
DEBUG:root:pat
DEBUG:root:pallavi
DEBUG:root:sam
DEBUG:root:DONE

```

```python
magicians = []
for magician in magicians:
     logging.debug(magician)

DEBUG:root:DONE

```
---
# Lots of errors in the book

Indenting where you shouldn't

Forgetting to indent where you should

Forgetting the colon :
```python
for magician in magicians
    logging.debug(magician)
```

---
# Numerical Lists
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range

The `range` function generates a series of numbers
```
class range(stop)
class range(start, stop[, step])
Rather than being a function, range is actually an immutable sequence type,
as documented in Ranges and Sequence Types â€” list, tuple, range.
```

```python
>>> for x in range(5):
...     logging.debug(x)
...
DEBUG:root:0
DEBUG:root:1
DEBUG:root:2
DEBUG:root:3
DEBUG:root:4
```

```python
>>> # range(3,9) effectively returns a list with the values:
>>> # 3,4,5,6,7,8
>>> for x in range(3,9):
...     logging.debug(x)
...
DEBUG:root:3
DEBUG:root:4
DEBUG:root:5
DEBUG:root:6
DEBUG:root:7
DEBUG:root:8
```

---
# .... immutable sequence type?

Notice on the last side I said 'effectively'...

Let's look at some Python fun to see what's going on.

```python
>>> x = range(10)
>>> type(x)
<class 'range'>
>>> numbers = list(range(10))
>>> type(numbers)
<class 'list'>
>>> numbers
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

---
# List Comprehension

Allows you to perform some actions on a list in one line of code.

Combines the for loop and creation of new elements into one line.

Book:  "List comprehensions are not always presented to beginners, but I have included them here because you'll most likely see them as soon as you start looking at other peoples code."

```python
>>> # Break it down after
>>> squares = [value ** 2 for value in range(1,11)]
>>> # Surrounded by brackets, so, the end result will be a list.
>>> # for value in range ::  our normal for loop
>>> # value ** 2 == Square each value in the list, 
>>> # and the result will be in a new list.
>>> squares
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

---
#  cars.py

Example code and output to talk about equality, conditions, etc.

All car manufacturers should be printed 'title' case, but BMW should be all caps.


```python
cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']

for car in cars:
  if car == 'bmw':
      print(car.upper())
  else:
      print(car.title()
```
```bash
Audi
BMW
Subaru
Toyota
```


Note: Using print, as those outputs aren't "logging" type statements.

---
# Boolean Expressions

Whether a statement is True or False

Used to track conditions/conditionals

```python
>>> game_active = True
>>> can_edit = False
>>> can_edit = true
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'true' is not defined
```

---
# Conditionals

"At the heart of every <i>if</i> statement is an expression that can be evaluated as True or False and is called a 'conditional test'"

Checking for equality:
```python
>>> car = "bmw" # Assigns 'bmw' to variable car
>>> car == "bmw" # Compares variable car to value "bmw"
True
```
```python
>>> car = "audi"
>>> car == "bmw"
False
```

Testing strings is 'case sensitive'
```python
>>> car = "Audi"
>>> car == "audi"
False
>>> car.lower() == "audi".lower()
True
```
---
# Checking for Inequality

```python
>>> requested_topping = "mushrooms"
>>> requested_topping != "anchovies"
True

```

! creates the 'inverse' of the resulting comparison

True becomes False

False becomes True

---
# Numerical Comparisons

```python
>>> age = 18
>>> age == 18
True
>>> age != 18
False
>>> age < 20
True
>>> age <= 17
False
>>> age > 15
True
>>> age >=18
True
```

```python
>>> age = 17
>>> if age < 21:
>>>     print("No drink for you.")

No drink for you.

```
---
# Multiple Conditions

'and' 'or'

```python
>>> age_0 = 22
>>> age_1 = 18
>>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >=21
False
```

## AND

<table width="50%">
   <tr style="font-weight: bold"><td></td><th>True</th><th>False</th></tr>
   <tr><th>True</th><td>True</td><td>False</td></tr>
   <tr><th>False</th><td>False</td><td>False</td></tr>
</table>

## OR

<table width="50%">
   <tr style="font-weight: bold"><td></td><th>True</th><th>False</th></tr>
   <tr><th>True</th><td>True</td><td>True</td></tr>
   <tr><th>False</th><td>True</td><td>False</td></tr>
</table>

---
# Checking lists

Is it IN the list?

```python
>>> requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']
>>> 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings
True
>>> 'bacon' in requested_toppings
False
```

Is it NOT IN the list?
```python
>>> banned_users = ['andrew', 'carolina', 'david']
>>> user  = 'marie'
>>> user not in banned_users
True
```

---
# if Statements

'one test and one action, simplest form'

```python
if -conditional test-:
    do something
```

```python
age = 19
if age >= 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote!")
```

Code sets the age variable, checks it against 18, and then decides to execute the commant.

```python
age = 19
if age >= 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote.")
    print("Have you registered to vote?")
```
---
# if-else Statements

if statements help execute an action when conditions are met, but usually programs need to do something else if they aren't met

* If you're 18 or older, you can vote, otherwise, you must wait.

```python
age = 17
if age >= 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote.")
    print("Have you registered to vote?")
else:
    print("Sorry, you're too young to vote.")
    print("Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18.")

```
---
# if-elif-else chain

If we need more than one or two 'branches' in the code, we can add more conditional checks

* Under the age of four, tickets are free, 
* otherwise if you're under the age of 18, tickets are 25 dollars. 
* For everyone else, the cost is $40.

```python
age = 12
if age < 4:
    print("Your admission cost is $0.")
elif age < 18:
    print("Your admission cost is $25.")
else:
    print("Your admission cost is $40.")
```

Supports 0 or more 'elif' statements

Once one scenario is reached as True, the rest are ignored.

Else block can be omitted

---
# Testing Multiple Conditions

Sometimes you want more than one action to happen based on events.

```python
requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese']

if 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings:
    print("Adding mushrooms.")
if 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings:
    print("Oh yes, all the pepperoni.")
if 'extra cheese' in requested_toppings:
    print("Adding extra cheese.")

print("\nFinished making your pizza.")

```
---
# Checking if a list is empty or not

```python
requested_toppings = []
if requested_toppings:
    for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
        print(f"Adding {requested_toppings}.")
else:
    print("Are you sure you want a plain pizza?")

```
---
# Using multiple lists

Check our pizza order against an available list of toppings.

```python
available_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese', 'olives',
                      'pineapple', 'pepperoni', 'green peppers']
requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'french fries', 'extra cheese']

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
    if requested_topping in available_toppings:
        print(f"Adding {requested_topping}")
    else:
        print("Sorry, we don't have {requested_topping}")
```

---
# Styles

```python

if age < 4: #looks good with whitespace
    pass # do nothing

if age<4: # looks ugly, add whitespace
    pass
```
